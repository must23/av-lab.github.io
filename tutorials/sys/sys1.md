# AWS
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.

# Features of Amazon EC2

Amazon EC2 provides the following features:

* Virtual computing environments, known as _instances_
* Preconfigured templates for your instances, known as _Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)_, that package the bits you need for your server (including the operating system and additional software)
* Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity for your instances, known as _instance types_
* Secure login information for your instances using _key pairs_ (AWS stores the public key, and you store the private key in a secure place)
* Storage volumes for temporary data that's deleted when you stop, hibernate, or terminate your instance, known as _instance store volumes_
* Persistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), known as _Amazon EBS volumes_
* Multiple physical locations for your resources, such as instances and Amazon EBS volumes, known as _Regions_ and _Availability Zones_
* A firewall that enables you to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach your instances using _security groups_ 
* Static IPv4 addresses for dynamic cloud computing, known as _Elastic IP addresses_
* Metadata, known as _tags_, that you can create and assign to your Amazon EC2 resources
* Virtual networks you can create that are logically isolated from the rest of the AWS Cloud, and that you can optionally connect to your own network, known as _virtual private clouds_ (VPCs)
