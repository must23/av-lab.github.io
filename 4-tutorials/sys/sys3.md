# Install a web server on the cloud

The **LAMP stack** is a popular [open-source solution stack](https://phoenixnap.com/glossary/what-is-open-source) used primarily in web development.

LAMP consists of four components necessary to establish a fully functional web development environment. The first letters of the components' names make up the LAMP acronym:

* **Linux** is an operating system used to run the rest of the components.
* [**Apache** **HTTP Server**](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-apache-on-centos-7) is a web server software used to serve static web pages.
* **MySQL** is a [relational database management system](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/what-is-a-relational-database) used for creating and managing web databases, but also for [data](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/best-database-software)[warehousing](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/data-warehouse-architecture-explained), application logging, e-commerce, etc.
* **PHP, Perl, and Python** are programming languages are used to create web applications.

Each component represents an essential layer of the stack. Together, the components are used to create database-driven, dynamic websites.

 Follow the following instructions from AWS documentation to install a web server on your AWS instance.

# Front-end Development

# Back-end Development
Back-end refers to the server side of web development. In other words, the server can serve multiple clients (or computers). Although HTML/CSS/JS provides a rich user interface, it runs entirely on clients' machines; in other words, it is completely decentralized and agnostic of different clients, which is a limiting factor. What if you want to perform some computation that relies on multiple clients? Say you want to show how many items are available in stock based on online customer records. Then you would need a `server` that aggregates the computation. LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) is a software stack that allows running server-side applications using primarily PHP language (and another language),  along with MySQL database and Apache server, which orchestrates HTTP communication.

In the next classes, we will learn how to develop a simple back-end for your robotic applications. By simple we mean using basic commands and tools in Linux avoiding specialized software and libraries as much as possible.

## Optional
### Native Python Server
Django and LAMP are technologies for back-end development that involves lots functionalities and performs security checks. If you don't need all these, and you want a simple server for prototype, you may use ptyhon's native [`http.server` ](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) library. Below is a short video tutorial.

### Flask
Flask is a small and lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and features that make creating web applications in Python easier. It gives developers flexibility and is a more accessible framework for new developers since you can build a web application quickly using only a single Python file. Here is a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&t=15s). 
Flask has it's own lightweight web server, but it is not suitable for production. You can run Apache with Flask by enabling `mod_wsgi`

### Django

* [Go through Django tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/django/)

### PHP
PHP is an old technology for back-end development and is tightly integrated with Apache. (I am personally not a big fan of PHP though.). Follow video below [`Learn PHP in Under 15 Minutes!`](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ysJjgzcZOPY) and run experiments in your AWS server.
